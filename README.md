## Overview
Implementation of Natter API from Neil Madden's excellent *API Security in Action* book.

Tagged each chapter exercise to make it easier to jump to a particular point in time. This seems to be more useful for how I may reference this material in the future (vs. tagging the chapter beginning and end, as the author does for the reference implementation at https://github.com/NeilMadden/apisecurityinaction), but we will see.
